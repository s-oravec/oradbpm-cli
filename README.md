# Oracle DB Package Manager CLI

Tool for accessing Oracle DB Package Manager repository

# Idea

I need something like npmjs.org + npm for modules written in Oracle PL/SQL and I've been unable to find any opensource solution, so here's my try.
Features are greatly inspired by npmjs.org and npm.

# Features

* Open sourced npm-style [client CLI](https://github.com/s-oravec/oradbpm-cli) written in node
	* lousy security - session cookie - sorry for that \_(ツ)_/¯ - any contributions regarding this are welcomed
* [Open sourced REST API server](https://github.com/s-oravec/oradbpm-repo) 

# Warning!!!

* very unstable right now, pretty all changes are breaking - do not use for production, yet
